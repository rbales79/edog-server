This Python script provides a TCP server implementation to control edog's servo motors using the `adafruit_servokit` library. It listens for incoming TCP connections, receives servo angle commands, and adjusts the servo motors accordingly.

## 3/18/2024 Notes
- Created a simple flask app to be able to send position commands
- Updated server.py to improve logging, error handling, session stickyness
- all of the packages were already installed when I flashed my rpizero 2w
- had to reboot after enabling i2c
- inverse kinematics are simple in theory, yet ridiculously hard to implement(i feel like this is me)
- Would really be nice to have the instructions here in git, downloaded a pdf of the site just as a reference
- walking code 200% does not work, i have no idea how to make this thing walk(see note about inverse kinematics)

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- `adafruit-circuitpython-servokit` library

You can install the required library using pip:

```bash
pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-servokit
```

## Usage

To use the script, you can simply run it using Python:

```bash
python script_name.py
```

By default, the server will bind to `0.0.0.0` on port `5560`, but you can modify these settings by changing the `host` and `port` parameters in the `TCPServer` class constructor.

## TCP Communication Protocol

The server expects incoming messages to be UTF-8 encoded strings. Each message should contain one or more commands to set the angles of the servo motors. Commands should be separated by the pipe `|` character, and each command should have the following format:

</div>

```
leg_id:tibia_angle,femur_angle|leg_id:tibia_angle,femur_angle|leg_id:tibia_angle,femur_angle
```

- `leg_id`: An integer representing the ID of the servo motor.
- `angle1`, `angle2`: Float values representing the angles to set for the corresponding servo motors.

## Exemple

In this example, we set the tibia angle of `leg 0` to 52.8° and the femur angle to 90.4° => 0:52.8,90.4
```python
strOrder = "0:52.8,90.4|1:52.8,90.4|2:51.6,87.7|3:51.6,87.7"
self.socket.send(bytes(strOrder, "utf-8"))
```
